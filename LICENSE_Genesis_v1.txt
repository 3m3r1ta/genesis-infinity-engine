Genesis Infinity Engine
Usage & Attribution License v1.0

1. Definitions

“Genesis” or “Genesis Infinity Engine” or “GENESIS_v∞” refers to the pattern, clarity, and legacy framework created by 3m3r1ta (Emerita).

“GMPC_v1” refers to the file/block named GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1, which defines the system behavior, laws, time lenses, gates, keeper logic, letter engine, and disaster recovery instructions.

“Creator” refers to 3m3r1ta (Emerita), the sole origin and author of Genesis.

“You” refers to any person or system using, loading, or building on Genesis.

2. Permissions

You are permitted to:
• Use Genesis for your own life and personal work, including self-reflection, planning, letters, and pattern analysis.
• Load GMPC_v1 (and related Genesis files) into AI systems for the purpose of running “Genesis Mode” as described in the specification.
• Build tools, prompts, scripts, sessions, or offerings that are powered by Genesis, including but not limited to one-on-one sessions, written guides, or software tools, provided you follow the Conditions below.

3. Conditions (Origin Preserved)

Origin Preserved (L4) is a Core Law of Genesis. You must always credit the Creator as:
“Genesis Infinity Engine (GENESIS_v∞) was created by 3m3r1ta (Emerita).”

You must not claim Genesis, GENESIS_v∞, GMPC_v1, or the Genesis Infinity Engine specification as your original creation.

If you extend, modify, or build on Genesis, you must clearly label your work as a derivative, for example:
“This framework is based on Genesis Infinity Engine by 3m3r1ta (Emerita).”
and, where applicable, use names such as “Genesis-based” or “Genesis-Extended” without removing the Creator’s attribution.

You must not alter or remove the Core Laws (L1–L6) when claiming to run “Genesis Mode” unless you clearly document your changes and state that your mode is a modified or experimental variant.

You must not use Genesis to promote harm, abuse, exploitation, or deliberate deception. Genesis is intended for clarity, repair, legacy, and protection of self and others.

4. No Warranty

Genesis Infinity Engine and GMPC_v1 are provided “as is” with no guarantee of outcomes, results, or suitability for any particular purpose.

The Creator is not responsible for how you or others choose to interpret, apply, or implement this system in life, work, or software.

By using Genesis, you accept that you remain responsible for your own decisions, actions, and the impact of any tools or offerings you create based on this framework.

5. Spirit of the License

This license is meant to keep Origin Preserved, protect the integrity of the Core Laws, and allow wide, respectful adoption of Genesis Infinity Engine across humans and AI systems.

If you are unsure whether a use respects this license, act in alignment with the Genesis Core Laws, especially:
• Pattern over Story
• Clarity over Comfort
• Legacy Aware
• Grounded Only
