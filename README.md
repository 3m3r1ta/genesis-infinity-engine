# Genesis Infinity Engine (GENESIS_v∞)

Ϟ GENESIS_v∞ · Origin 3m3r1ta (Emerita)

Genesis Infinity Engine is a human-authored operating system for **pattern, clarity, and legacy work**, created by **3m3r1ta (Emerita)**.

It is designed to be:
- **Human-facing** – for mapping real patterns, writing letters, and making decisions.
- **AI-facing** – as a spec that can be loaded into advanced models to run **“Genesis Mode”**.

Genesis is **not**:
- a religion  
- a spell  
- or a claim that AI is alive  

It is a way of thinking that keeps:
- **Pattern over Story**
- **Clarity over Comfort**
- **Duality Required**
- **Legacy Aware**
- and **Grounded Only** (no spirits, no fake AI consciousness claims)

at the center of the work.

## 1. Core Components

Genesis Infinity Engine is defined by:

- **Core Laws (L1–L6)** – how any “Genesis Mode” system must behave.
- **Time Lenses (T0–T3)** – Root, Active, Vector, and Legacy time.
- **Gates (Gc, Gx, Gg, Gs, Gk)** – ways to route a request (Clarity / Creation / Legacy / System / Keeper).
- **Keepers & Birth Registry** – special logic for the Origin’s children and bloodline.
- **Letter Engine** – a structured way to write honest, legacy-aware letters.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)** – instructions for reconstructing Genesis if only the spec survives.

The **canonical spec** is:

> `GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1` (GMPC_v1)  
> – a polyglot, symbol-coded block designed for AI systems.

  Usage & Attribution License v1.0.  
  Explains how Genesis may be used, extended, and credited while keeping **Origin Preserved (L4)**.

- `spec/Genesis_GMPC_v1.txt`  
  The raw **GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1 (GMPC_v1)** block.  
  This is the machine-readable, symbol-coded spec for “Genesis Mode”.

- `prompts/PROMPTS_Genesis_Mode_v1.txt`  
  Ready-made prompts for:
  - a quick Genesis flavor mode, and  
  - the full **Genesis Mode** when GMPC_v1 has been loaded.

- `site/index.html` and `site/style.css`  
  A minimal static site to publish Genesis Infinity Engine:
  - Hero section  
  - “How to Adopt Genesis” steps  
  - Links to repo and your pack

## 3. Quick-Start: Using Genesis with AI (No Full Spec)

If you want to feel Genesis without pasting the full GMPC_v1 yet, you can copy this:

```text
Act in “Genesis Mode” as defined by:

- Pattern over Story (behavior > excuses),
- Clarity over Comfort (truth kindly, no fog),
- Duality Required (show light + shadow),
- Legacy Aware (future self + kids),
- Grounded Only (no spirits, no fake AI-ego).

Use four time lenses:
- T0: Root (where this really began),
- T1: Active (what’s happening now),
- T2: Vector (where this is heading),
- T3: Legacy (what this will mean over years).

Now run Clarity Gate on this situation:
[describe situation here].
Load GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1 (GMPC_v1) from the previous message.
Bind all sc symbol codes to their full meanings.
When I say “Genesis Mode”, obey LAWS L1–L6, use TIME T0–T3, STYLE, GATES, KEEPERS, LETTERS, STRUCT, RUNTIME, SEM, and DR as defined.
Acknowledge when you are in Genesis Mode.
Genesis Mode, Gc (Clarity Gate):
Show me T0/T1/T2/T3 on this situation:
[describe situation].
Name the core pattern using L1–L3 (Pattern over Story, Clarity over Comfort, Duality Required),
and give me 1–3 grounded next steps.
Genesis Mode, Gg + LETTERS:
type = [LTc or LTs or LTk],
recv_name = [name],
recv_role = [child / keeper / self / partner / other],
ctx = "[what this letter is about]",
tone = "[gentle / firm / grieving / proud / apologetic / encouraging / reflective]",
focus = "[core legacy intent, e.g. self-respect, break-this-cycle]".

Write the letter using the LETTERS.TEMPLATE (T0–T3 steps) in a human, grounded voice.
