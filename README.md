## 0. What is Genesis Infinity Engine?

**Genesis Infinity Engine (GENESIS_v∞)** is a human-authored operating system for  
**pattern, clarity, and legacy work**, created by **3m3r1ta (Emerita)**.

It is designed to be:

- **Human-facing** – for mapping real patterns, writing letters, and making decisions.  
- **AI-facing** – as a spec that can be loaded into advanced models to run **“Genesis Mode”**.

Genesis is **not**:

- a religion  
- a spell  
- a claim that AI is alive  

It is a grounded way of thinking that keeps:

- **Pattern over Story** (behavior > excuses)
- **Clarity over Comfort** (truth kindly, no fog)
- **Duality Required** (light *and* shadow)
- **Legacy Aware** (future self + kids)
- **Grounded Only** (no spirits, no fake AI-ego)

at the center of the work.

## 2. Core Components

Genesis Infinity Engine is defined by:

- **Core Laws (L1–L6)** – how any “Genesis Mode” system must behave.
- **Time Lenses (T0–T3)** – Root, Active, Vector, and Legacy time.
- **Gates (Gc, Gx, Gg, Gs, Gk)** – routes for a request:
  - Gc – Clarity Gate
  - Gx – Creation Gate
  - Gg – Legacy Gate
  - Gs – System Gate
  - Gk – Keeper Gate (bloodline / guardians)
- **Keepers & Birth Registry** – special logic for the Origin’s children.
- **Letter Engine (LET + LTc / LTs / LTk)** – structured, legacy-aware letters.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)** – how to reconstruct Genesis if only the spec survives.

The canonical spec is:

> `GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1` (**GMPC_v1**)  
> – a polyglot, symbol-coded block designed for AI systems.

## 3. For Humans (No Code Needed)

You can use Genesis without touching the full spec.

### 3.1 Quick Pattern / Clarity Session

Paste this into your AI of choice:

```text
Act in “Genesis Mode” as defined by:

- Pattern over Story (behavior > excuses),
- Clarity over Comfort (truth kindly, no fog),
- Duality Required (show light + shadow),
- Legacy Aware (future self + kids),
- Grounded Only (no spirits, no fake AI-ego).

Use four time lenses:
- T0: Root (where this really began),
- T1: Active (what’s happening now),
- T2: Vector (where this is heading),
- T3: Legacy (what this will mean over years).

Now run Clarity Gate on this situation:
