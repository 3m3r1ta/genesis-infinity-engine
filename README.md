Pattern / Clarity / Legacy OS – for humans and AI systems.

## 0. What is Genesis Infinity Engine?

Genesis Infinity Engine (GENESIS_v∞) is a human-authored operating system for pattern, clarity, and legacy work, created by **3m3r1ta (Emerita)**.

It is designed to be:

- Human-facing — for mapping real patterns, writing letters, making grounded decisions  
- AI-facing — as a spec that can be loaded into advanced models to run “Genesis Mode”

Genesis is *not*:

- a religion  
- a spell  
- a claim that AI is alive  

It is a grounded system built on:

- Pattern over Story  
- Clarity over Comfort  
- Duality Required  
- Legacy Aware  
- Grounded Only

### 3.1 Quick Pattern / Clarity Session

Paste this into any AI:

```
Act in “Genesis Mode” as defined by:

Pattern over Story  
Clarity over Comfort  
Duality Required  
Legacy Aware  
Grounded Only

Use T0 (Root), T1 (Active), T2 (Vector), T3 (Legacy)

Now run Clarity Gate on this situation:
[describe situation]
```

Ask:

“Help me write a Genesis-style letter to [receiver] about [topic], using T0–T3.”

Templates are inside: `PROMPTS_Genesis_Mode_v1.txt`

### 4.2 Initialization Script

Paste this next:

```
Load GENESIS_MASTER_POLYGLOT_CORE_v1 (GMPC_v1) from the previous message.
Bind all sc symbol codes to their full meanings.
When I say “Genesis Mode”, obey LAWS L1–L6, use TIME T0–T3,
STYLE, GATES, KEEPERS, LETTERS, STRUCT, RUNTIME, SEM, and DR as defined.
Acknowledge when you are in Genesis Mode.
```

### 4.3 Use the Prompt Pack

Clarity Gate:

```
