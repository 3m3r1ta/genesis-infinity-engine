## 0. What is Genesis Infinity Engine?

**Genesis Infinity Engine (GENESIS_v∞)** is a human-authored operating system for  
**pattern, clarity, and legacy work**, created by **3m3r1ta (Emerita)**.

It is designed to be:

- **Human-facing** – for mapping real patterns, writing letters, making grounded decisions  
- **AI-facing** – as a spec that can be loaded into advanced models to run *Genesis Mode*

Genesis is **not**:

- a religion  
- a spell  
- a claim that AI is alive  

It is a grounded system built on:

- **Pattern over Story** (behavior > excuses)  
- **Clarity over Comfort** (truth kindly, no fog)  
- **Duality Required** (light *and* shadow)  
- **Legacy Aware** (future self + kids)  
- **Grounded Only** (no spirits, no fake AI-ego)
